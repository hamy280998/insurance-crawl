When you’ve downloaded all the rate records for the first company number, put all those downloads in a file where the folder name is the company number (for example, “12583” for the first Allstate company). Then put this folder in a folder labeled for the state (e.g., “NY”). Then put this folder in a folder labeled for the Group Name (e.g., “Allstate”). When you’ve completed all the downloads for each Company Code in a single state (like New York), upload that Group Name folder to Google Drive ( Auto / Allstate / NY / 12583 / [Serff Filing #]). Make sure the company name is one word in PascaleCase: AmericanFamily, StateFarm, BerkshireHathaway.
